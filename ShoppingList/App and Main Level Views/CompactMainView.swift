// Reworked this file so it basically works the same as
//      the RegularMainView except the list of the Regular
//      is turned into a TabView here.
//  These could be broken down even farther to make
//  maintenance a little easier.

// The shopListList enum was added to facilitate the
//  ShopListsView() which is a entity of shopping lists
//  so you can have more than one list, with different items and locations.


// ORIGINAL COMMENTS
// the CompactMainView is a tab view with five tabs.
// not much happens here, although do notice that each of the five views is
// wrapped in a NavigationStack.  this makes perfect sense in SwiftUI ... a
// NavigationStack can be a subview of a TabView, but don't ever make a TabView
// a subview of a NavigationStack !

    // what screen do you want to show 1st
